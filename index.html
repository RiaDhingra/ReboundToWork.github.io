        <P>
            Debilitating diseases come in many shapes and forms – from those that attack the muscles in our body and affect our physical abilities to those that affect our brain function and impair our thought processes. People who recover from debilitating diseases face a number of challenges including the willpower to return-to-work or performing at par with their colleagues after their return. The longer people are out of work as a result of an illness, the less likely they are to return to work. Becoming truly resilient enables people to not just rebound and bounce back but to bounce forward in their personal and professional lives. In this session, you’ll learn from the personal experiences of a cancer survivor who will share a framework to become truly resilient and use that to successfully transition and thrive at work.
            We will dive into a framework that enables us to rebound with positive thinking, rebuild resiliency to bounce forward, and uplift others along the way.
